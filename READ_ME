First, run the server and wait until it has started a connection and is listening

Then, Set up your client.py and carer_client.py files in two different command lines

press enter on both so that the client is the first connector, and the carer is the second

Then click enger a few times on the client.py command line, and after, hit enter a few times on the 
carer_client.py command window

you should then be able to see all of the information on the server command line, the warnings sent to the 
carer and patient in respective command windows, and you should be able to see the phone calling if you
have asked to input your phone information
